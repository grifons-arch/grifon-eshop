# grifon-gateway

Secure proxy/gateway between an Android app and a PrestaShop multishop installation. The gateway exposes a clean REST JSON API and keeps the PrestaShop API key private.

## Features

- Shop-aware routing with `shopId` (1 or 4, default 4).
- Active-only filtering for categories, products, and CMS pages.
- Price visibility enforced by customer/group rules.
- XML fallback parsing when upstream does not return JSON.
- Caching (in-memory or Redis) with TTLs.
- Security middleware: helmet, CORS, rate limiting, request IDs, structured logs.

## Setup

```bash
cd grifon-gateway
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev

- Prices are only returned when a customer is active and their default group has `show_prices=1`.
- When prices are not allowed, price fields are set to `null`.
- Product image URLs are constructed using the selected shop domain.
- `/auth/register` creates customers with `PENDING_WHOLESALE_APPROVAL` status (inactive or in a pending group).
